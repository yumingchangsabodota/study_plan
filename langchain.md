# LangChain Study Plan

## Section 1: Introduction to LangChain & LLMs
### Topics:
- What is LangChain? Overview and use cases.
- Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering.
- Setting up LangChain and integrating with OpenAI/LLMs.
- Using LangChain's `LLMChain` for basic text generation.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Simple Chatbot**
- Create a basic chatbot using LangChain with OpenAI’s GPT.
- Allow user input and return a response using `LLMChain`.

---

## Section 2: Chains & Memory in LangChain
### Topics:
- Understanding and building chains (`SimpleSequentialChain`, `SequentialChain`).
- Adding memory to chains (`ConversationBufferMemory`, `ConversationSummaryMemory`).
- Implementing structured memory in a chatbot.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Conversational AI Assistant**
- Implement a chatbot with memory that remembers previous interactions.
- Use `ConversationBufferMemory` to maintain context.

---

## Section 3: Prompt Templates and Customizing Outputs
### Topics:
- Using `PromptTemplate` to structure dynamic prompts.
- Creating reusable prompt templates.
- Experimenting with different LLM models for responses.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build an AI-Powered Resume Analyzer**
- Accept a resume as input.
- Use `PromptTemplate` to structure an analysis prompt.
- Return insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the resume.

---

## Section 4: Document Processing & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
### Topics:
- Loading and processing documents with `DocumentLoaders`.
- Using `TextSplitter` to break long documents into chunks.
- Implementing `VectorStores` and embeddings.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a PDF Q&A System**
- Allow users to upload a PDF.
- Extract text, split it into chunks, and use embeddings to store the information.
- Implement a chatbot that answers questions based on the document.

---

## Section 5: Agents & Tools
### Topics:
- Understanding `Agents` and `AgentExecutor`.
- Using `Tools` to extend agent capabilities.
- Customizing and creating new tools.
- Integrating external APIs with LangChain.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Personal AI Research Assistant**
- Implement an agent that fetches real-time data from APIs (e.g., news, Wikipedia).
- Answer user queries using multiple tools and LLM reasoning.
- Allow follow-up questions and adapt responses dynamically.

---

## Section 6: Advanced LangChain - Multi-modal & Custom Models
### Topics:
- Integrating LangChain with images, audio, and video.
- Using LangChain with local models (`llama.cpp`, `GPT4All`).
- Fine-tuning custom LLMs for domain-specific tasks.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Multi-modal AI Assistant**
- Accept text and images as input.
- Use an API like OpenAI’s vision models or CLIP for image understanding.
- Return intelligent responses based on both image and text.

---

## Section 7: Building & Deploying LangChain Applications
### Topics:
- Deploying LangChain apps using FastAPI or Flask.
- Hosting and scaling with cloud services (AWS, GCP, or Hugging Face Spaces).
- Optimizing performance and cost efficiency.

### Final Hands-on Project:
**Choose One:**
1. **Deploy an AI Chatbot as a Web App** (Using FastAPI & Streamlit)
   - Implement a conversational agent with memory.
   - Deploy it as a web app where users can chat with it.

2. **Build a Smart AI Email Assistant**
   - Fetch emails from an inbox using APIs.
   - Use LangChain to summarize and suggest responses.
   - Implement an interface to interact with email suggestions.

3. **Create a LangChain-powered CLI Research Tool**
   - Accept search queries and fetch information from multiple sources.
   - Summarize findings and generate reports.
   - Allow interactive follow-up questions.
