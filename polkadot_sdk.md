# Polkadot SDK Study Plan

## Section 1: Building a Custom Blockchain with Substrate
### Topics:
- Substrate node template and runtime structure.
- Understanding Pallets (Prebuilt vs. Custom).
- FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modular Entities).
- Storage, Events, and Errors in Substrate.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Custom Blockchain**
- Modify the Substrate node template.
- Add a custom pallet to store and retrieve simple key-value pairs.
- Use `substrate-node` CLI to interact with the blockchain.

---

## Section 2: Smart Contracts on Polkadot with Ink!
### Topics:
- Writing smart contracts using `ink!`.
- Deploying contracts on Substrate-based chains.
- Testing and interacting with smart contracts using `cargo contract`.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Simple Token Contract**
- Create an ERC-20-style token using `ink!`.
- Implement minting, transfers, and balance checks.
- Deploy and interact with the contract on a local Substrate node.

---

## Section 3: Cross-Chain Communication & XCM
### Topics:
- Implementing Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM).
- Executing cross-chain transactions.
- Setting up a relay chain and parachains.

### Hands-on Project:
**Send Tokens Between Parachains**
- Set up two local parachains.
- Configure XCM messages to transfer assets.
- Implement basic governance controls for cross-chain operations.

---

## Section 4: Governance & Staking in Polkadot
### Topics:
- On-chain governance (Democracy, Council, Treasury).
- Implementing staking mechanisms in Substrate.
- Voting and referenda on-chain.

### Hands-on Project:
**Implement a Custom Governance Module**
- Create a pallet that allows token holders to vote on proposals.
- Implement different voting mechanisms (Simple majority, weighted voting).
- Integrate the governance module into a Substrate chain.

---

## Section 5: Advanced Substrate Development & Performance Optimization
### Topics:
- Optimizing runtime performance.
- Weight-based transaction fees.
- Benchmarking and profiling Substrate chains.
- Building decentralized applications (dApps) on Polkadot.

### Hands-on Project:
**Build a Scalable NFT Marketplace**
- Implement an NFT module with ownership and transfers.
- Optimize transaction fees for minting and listing NFTs.
- Deploy a frontend to interact with the marketplace.

---

## Section 6: Deploying and Running a Polkadot-based Chain
### Topics:
- Connecting a parachain to the Polkadot relay chain.
- Running a full node vs. collator node.
- Monitoring blockchain health and security.
- Deploying a Substrate chain on cloud infrastructure.

### Final Hands-on Project:
**Choose One:**
1. **Launch Your Own Substrate Blockchain**
   - Set up a real-world network with multiple nodes.
   - Implement staking, governance, and custom logic.
   - Monitor performance and optimize consensus.

2. **Develop a Decentralized Identity System**
   - Use Substrate to manage decentralized identity (DID).
   - Implement verifiable credentials.
   - Deploy on a testnet.

3. **Build a Polkadot-Integrated DeFi Protocol**
   - Create a lending/borrowing mechanism using `ink!` smart contracts.
   - Implement staking for yield generation.
   - Allow cross-chain asset movement via XCM.
